Use DuckDuckGo for !bangs and Google for everything else!


Local Setup
-----------
Clone repository and install dependencies using: `npm install --save`.

Run `run.sh` and set it up so that it is automatically run on login.

DuckDuckGoog is now running on [127.0.0.1:6006](http://127.0.0.1:6006).

You may want to set it as your default search engine. Setting it as the default fallback for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is also strongly recommended.
